    <h2>Interactivity &amp; Animations</h2>
    <p>
      Especially because of mobile micro-interactions matter a lot nowaday. They
      are not optional anymore. Animations bring life into a design and make
      things tangible. It brings the focus on a special element, but sometimes
      also bring tranquility when the movement is slow.
