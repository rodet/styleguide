      This page is intended as a living document on how to style my internet
      pages, wherever they live. It contains hints on colours, form, typography
      and will be enriched as the design progresses.

    <p>
      In the world of front-end, very often there is that weird dichotomy
      between "front-end" and "mobile" developers. While the latter stay mostly
      busy with phones and tablets, and integrate a lot of micro-interactions
      and use a lot of native tools, many web developers still hang onto
      desktops. They use it not only as a development, but also as a test
      platform. As a result, many websites are way too heavy. Often, neither the
      media nor the code shows any sign of optimization. Websites built using
      the present set of components should be pleasant and natural to use on
      mobile. But, as the web platform allows for it, it should also be
      delightful on desktop, and make reasonable use of the screen real estate.
